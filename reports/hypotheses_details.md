### Hypotheses

#### **H1: Elevated troponin and CK-MB levels are strong predictors of heart attack occurrence.**  
- **Rationale**:  
  - Troponin and CK-MB are biomarkers released during cardiac muscle damage.  
  - Troponin is highly cardiac-specific; CK-MB is less specific but still clinically useful.  
- **Implication**: If supported, this reinforces their diagnostic use in emergency settings.  

#### **H2: Patients with higher blood pressure and glucose levels show higher likelihood of a heart attack.**  
- **Rationale**:  
  - **Hypertension** strains the heart and accelerates atherosclerosis.  
  - **Hyperglycemia** (e.g., in diabetes) promotes vascular inflammation and plaque formation.  
- **Implication**: Highlights the need for controlling BP and glucose to mitigate risk.  

#### **H3: Age is positively correlated with heart attack probability, especially in males.**  
- **Rationale**:  
  - Aging increases arterial stiffness and cumulative damage.  
- **Implication**: Supports age-targeted preventive strategies.  

### Connections  
- **H1**: Diagnostic biomarkers.  
- **H2**: Modifiable risk factors.  
- **H3**: Non-modifiable risk factors.
